This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
vb <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensVolleyballData/main/data/ncaa_womens_volleyball_matchstats_2022.csv")
```
```{r}
glimpse(vb)
```
```{r}
perset <- vb %>% 
  mutate(
    killsperset = kills/s,
    acesperset = aces/s,
    digsperset = digs/s
    
    
  ) %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_killsperset = mean(killsperset),
    mean_acesperset = mean(acesperset),
    mean_digsperset = mean(digsperset)
  )
```
```{r}
glimpse(perset)
```
```{r}
teamzscore <- perset %>% 
  mutate(
    killszscore = as.numeric(scale(mean_killsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(mean_digsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(mean_acesperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) * -1,
    TotalZscore = killszscore + digszscore + aceszscore
  )
```
```{r}
head(teamzscore)
```
```{r}
teamzscore %>% arrange(desc(TotalZscore))
```
This tells us that Tulsa averages more kills, digs and aces per set than any team in the country, followed by UC Irvine and Loyola Maryland. While those top three aren't ranked in the latest AVCA coaches' poll top-25, Rice is No. 22, Mississippi State competes in the SEC and Nebraska is ranked No. 3. 
```{r}
teamzscore %>% 
  filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps") %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalZscore)) %>%
  select(team, TotalZscore)
```
Maryland is not averaging a whole lot of aces, digs and kills per set. That puts the Terps in the company of schools like Columbia, Stonehill, Lafayette and Alcorn (State?). Not very good, but just one metric.
